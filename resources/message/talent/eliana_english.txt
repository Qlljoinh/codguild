Eliana
 Skill set: 5555
 The best paired heroes (in descending order): Garwood
♡ The best artifacts (in descending order): The Manuscript of the Prophecy, the Harlequin Mask
♧ Talent Tree:
The only time you can really use Eliana as your primary commander is when you just started playing on a new server, just took on Garwood and are looking for a defensive line with a lot of healing without investing too much in Garwood (initially). In this case, you can use Eliana as the primary commander of your legion with this talent tree.
