♧ Talent Tree:
1) A talent tree for dealing counterattack damage, which allows you to deal maximum damage where you need it.
2) This is probably the most viable build in the open field, using damage on a single target, but also applying debuffs and silence to be as annoying as possible in all PvP situations.
