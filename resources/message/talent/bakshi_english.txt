♧ Talent Tree:
1) This is building a rage set with high skill damage, which many players fear when bakshi lures them into an open field. The only downside here is a little survivability, so don't overdo it and know when to back off, otherwise your fun will end very quickly and rudely.
2) This is a set of talents for the same use case (hunting in the field), but with more survivability, so you don't have to watch Bakshi so carefully when you hunt down other players.
