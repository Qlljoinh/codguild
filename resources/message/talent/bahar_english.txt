♧ Talent Tree:
Gone are the days when Bahar could be used as a hero for the early garrison. Now you can use it either as a tank or together with more resilient infantry.
1) This is the first talent tree for a fun infantry legion, which deals good damage and is generally quite balanced.
2) This tree build is designed to be used with hardier and more defensive infantry heroes, as well as as a tank legion in the early days on your server.
But using Bahar as the legion's primary commander is something I don't recommend you do.
