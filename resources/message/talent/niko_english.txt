♧ Talent Tree:
1) The first talent tree is designed to increase the normal damage from the shooter's attack and works quite well in all areas where you could use Nico.
2) This set of talents is designed primarily for PvE content, in particular for giants, where it will help you inflict as much damage as possible.
