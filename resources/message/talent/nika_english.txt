♧ Talent Tree:
1) This is one of two working talent combinations for Niki. If you use it with a hero who deals counterattack damage or increases counterattack damage, then this is the talent tree you need
2) In this talent tree, the focus is on using Niki as a tank and dealing damage with skills. If you combine her with any hero who deals damage with skills and does not have counterattack skills (unlocked), then this talent tree is your choice.
