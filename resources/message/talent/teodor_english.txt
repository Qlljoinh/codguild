♧ Talent Tree:
1) This is the most useful talent tree build that you will use in any situation except in Theodore's garrison. I advise you to use the skill tree, as it is the strongest of all, and in many situations I would choose Theodore in the first place only to use this tree if there are no other important reasons. The talents there are simply magnificent, and if you follow these recommendations, you will get maximum pleasure from Theodore.
2) This is a garrison assembly, in case you want to place it there. Again, I do not recommend doing this, as there are more suitable heroes for this, but if you do not have them and you want to use Theodore, then this is exactly the build that I recommend to you.
