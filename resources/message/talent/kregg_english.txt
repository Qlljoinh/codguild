♧ Talent Tree:
1) This is the perfect talent tree setting if you play as an Orc faction and control a Cregg with flying troops. This is a pretty quick set-up of talents for ambush attacks, which goes very well with his equipment and is a lot of fun.
2) If you have chosen the Elf faction, then this talent tree is best suited for high damage flying eagles, but you will also need the Cregg awakening skill to work effectively.
