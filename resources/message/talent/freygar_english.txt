♧ Talent Tree:
1) This tree is suitable for all combinations when you use Freygar together with flying units to fly over the terrain and be very mobile. Ideally, it should be used together with flying orc units (wyverns), but it also goes well with all other flying units.
2) If you combine Freygar with Sindrion and hunt legions of magicians, then this is the perfect talent tree for that.
