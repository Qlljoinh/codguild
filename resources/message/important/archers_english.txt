Marches of the best shooters

As I mentioned earlier, in an ideal future, you should have two marches of shooters to deal the necessary damage later in the game. Below you will find the pairs that you should make to get there.

At the beginning of the game, you will use one march of shooters, which you will develop until you make progress, and then separate them.

● March of the best shooters for beginners
You'll get Nico out pretty early, and you should use him along with Guanyin for your early march (see picture 1).
Pump the Guanguin as much as possible, because you just don't have many other options.

● March of the best shooters in the middle of the game
When you get to the middle of the game, it's time to improve your shooter with Kinnara (see picture 2), and this will help you hold out for some more time, so do not hesitate to invest money in it.
However, if you are not investing in the game, then I advise you not to invest universal tokens in Kinnara, but to accumulate them for Sindrion.

● The march of the best shooters in the final part
For the final formation of the marches, I recommend that you build two detachments of shooters: Kinnara + Hosk and Sindrion + Freygar (see picture 3).
Note: The Hosk is just perfect, but I understand that not every player has a Hosk or will ever get one. And yet, if you take Hosk, then I also recommend the striped bear, in this bundle of heroes, because of the great health bonus. And since this march of shooters has a shorter distance to the target, you will not depend so much on health.
And Sindrion + Freygar are so incredible that you just need this bundle!
