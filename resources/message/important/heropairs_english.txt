A guide to creating the best pairs of heroes and legions.

A competent combination of heroes (kamandir + deputy) for your legions can give you excellent synergy and make your legion stronger. And combining unsuitable heroes will make your legion more vulnerable and weak.
If you are an experienced player, then you know in advance which heroes you should pay attention to and who to replace them with at the initial stage until the heroes you need appear in the game. However, if you do not have enough experience in this game, and you find it difficult to choose which characters to download at different stages of the game, then read this article. This will help you understand the principle of selecting heroes and legions. 

At the start of the game, I recommend paying attention to the archers. Because, in the first season, the capture of giants will play a key role in the successful development of the alliance. And on the giants, it is the archers who inflict the maximum damage. Therefore, at the start of the game, a good bunch will be Nico + Guanouin (see picture 1).
▪︎ When the main bunch of heroes that you have chosen to start has been upgraded to level 60 (commander and his deputy), proceed to improve the infantry squad for melee tanks and the magic squad for area damage and some control (see picture 2).
▪︎ When the fourth legion becomes available to you, then you need to improve your infantry + magic + rifle legions and add a cavalry legion (see picture 3).
▪︎ Eventually, you will aim for two infantry legions, one magic legion and two rifle legions (see picture 4)
▪︎ If you are interested, your cavalry legion will not be lost. However, it is rather a legion that you use separately and only when you need it, and not together with your other legions.
And yet, in addition to the main legions, you should also have these two cavalry legions (see picture 5) to move quickly around the map or cover long distances after opening a passage for a fun PvP in the field.
