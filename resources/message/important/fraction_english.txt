Choosing the right faction in Call of Dragons

‚óè The best hero when choosing a faction.
You can get and test the initial hero from another faction by pulling. Therefore, the initial hero does not matter in choosing a faction.
And yet you should know that among the three starting heroes, Waldir is the fastest to increase his capabilities and is considered the best epic hero.
However, there is more PVE content in the first season, the main of which is the capture of giants! And it is precisely on the giants that archers are much more useful than magicians. It is the archers who give more damage when capturing a giant than the magicians. And the victory over the giants in the first season determines the prestige of the alliance, which players from other alliances strive to get into, which significantly helps the alliance to build momentum and strength faster. And the members of the alliance, who are the first to capture elite giants, receive exclusive frames...a bonus, but very pleasant. üòÅ

‚óè Which faction is the best for you?
‚ñ™Ô∏é If you are not in a very active alliance and collect a lot, stay in the "League of Order" for the sake of a collection bonus until you want to fight more often.
‚ñ™Ô∏é If you like PvP battles in the open field and brawls, choose the "Guardians of the Source", because the healing bonus that you get for wounded soldiers is of great importance and helps you keep your legions active and well-fed.
‚ñ™Ô∏é If your alliance is active on the map, consider getting a bonus for fortification when destroying the Wild Camp, but this is only real if you are in a very active alliance!
