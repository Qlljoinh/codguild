The best combinations of cavalry

Cavalry is fun because you can intercept and chase players. There are many options, but they need to be carefully chosen, because this squad is fun, does a lot of damage, moves quickly, but is also vulnerable. Therefore, you will not use cavalry for most other everyday tasks.

And so, for interception and hunting, the first option of assembling a squad is perfect for you (see picture 1).

Eagles (flying cavalry units), which only the Guardians of the Source faction has, are perfect for overcoming huge distances with cavalry. And for flying eagles, the second assembly is perfect for you (see picture 2). This is a fast, not too difficult to create a quick intercept command, but still it does some damage when completing tasks.

And finally, the third and wildest march, in which the top player invests (see picture 3).
