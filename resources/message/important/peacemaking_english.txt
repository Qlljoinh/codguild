Is it worth pumping peacemaking in the talent branch?

Despite the fact that some heroes, including Lilia (who is only worried about donating), have a branch of talents for peacemaking, I still do not recommend using and pumping heroes in this direction. Any hero created by the game for peacekeeping purposes can be redirected to the side for PvP battles. And since this game has been aimed at PvP content since the second season, and on some servers already since the first season (who will be lucky with opponents in the first season), you need as many heroes as possible for:
▪︎ Military PvP objectives
▪︎ a campaign against cities (burn opponents, destroying their legions and pulling out resources)
▪︎ as well as a campaign against outposts to intercept gates from the enemy.
Therefore, I recommend that you forget about peacemaking and remember that we play with live opponents first of all, fighting for supremacy on the server in PvP battles. And if your main characters run out of stamina at the wrong time in the war, you can easily replace them with other heroes if they all swing for PvP battles.
