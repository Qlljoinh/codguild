The best combinations of magicians

● The best magic starting march
The good thing is that in Call of Dragons you will immediately get a great epic hero who will be very useful and powerful.
This march looks very simple (see Picture 1), but Waldir does a ton of damage over an area, and Aluin has a lot of control. And depending on which of them has a higher level and skills, you can swap these characters. But if you plan to buy a Lily in the near future and invest in it, then I do not recommend getting carried away with Aluin, since you will quickly replace it with a Lily.

● The progressive march of Magicians
One of the few really valuable things worth spending money on in Call of Dragons is a Lily. She is an amazing hero that you will use for many seasons in a row.
Lily does a lot of damage in the area and goes well with the Waldir (see picture 2).
☆ Remember that you will use the Lily until the end of the game, so don't spare any money on it! ☆
This bundle of heroes will work well for quite a while, but at some point it will be time to upgrade it to a more powerful one that does more damage. Therefore, in later stages, I recommend replacing Waldir with Velin (see picture 3).
At the moment, this is the most common and best magic squad at any stage of the game. And even considering the fact that flying magic heroes have appeared in the game, Lily + Velin are the best magic combination.

● The final magic March
So what about Bertrand and Tohar (see picture 4)?
The problem with them is the amount of gold shards and stars that you have to put into them to improve these heroes to the point where they can bypass Lilia and Velina. At the same time, Bertrand and Tohar work well only in pairs with each other. Therefore, if you are super lucky and you pull them out, I would recommend creating this bunch of heroes as a second magical march in the distant future.
